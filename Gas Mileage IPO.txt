pricePerMile
pricePerGallon
averagePricePerGallon
milesPerGallon

Algorithm:
1. Prompt the user to enter the beginMiles
3. Prompt the user to enter the endMiles
2. Prompt the user to enter the gallonsOfGas
3. Prompt the user to enter the gasPrice
4. milesTotal = endMiles - beginMiles	
5. milesPerGallon = milesTotal / gallonsOfGas
6. Display milesTotal to the screen
7. Diaplay milesPerGallon to the screen
